        <p className="mb-3">I’m a hopeful Software Engineer shifting over from over 8 years of Mechanical
            Engineering experience. I've completed a 65+ hour web development bootcamp, where I learned
            HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express. I have also completed a 45+ hour ReactJS bootcamp that included ReactJS, MUI, NextJS, and Express.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-0">I enjoy learning new skills and honing them through real-world applications. I’m
            excited to apply my mechanical engineering and product development experience to my career as a
            Software Engineer.
