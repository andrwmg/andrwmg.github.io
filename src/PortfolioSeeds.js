        description: "Tesla Mart is a CRUD web app  where current and future Tesla owners can buy and sell their vehicles.  The layout was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, while the back-end was built using the REST architecture with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.  Every page of the website is fully responsive.  The filtering and sorting functionality was difficult to implement, but it is now flawless. The filter dropdowns update depending on which other filters are active."
