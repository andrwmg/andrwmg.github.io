        description: "After completing my React bootcamp, I rebuilt Tesla Mart from scratch to solidify my new skills.  I used MUI to create a polished, responsive website. Storing data from API RESTful requests in the state and breaking the website down into components made the code easier to follow and organize.  New features includes: profile pictures, reordering of the listing images, messaging between users, and more!"
