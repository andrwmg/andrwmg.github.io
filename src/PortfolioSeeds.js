        description: "After completing my React bootcamp, I rebuilt Tesla Mart from scratch to solidify my new skills. I found it much easier to create a polished, responsive website using MUI. Storing data from API REST requests in the state was a breeze, and breaking the website down into components made the code easier to follow and organize. New features includes: profile pictures, reordering of the listing images, messaging between users, and more! I'd still like to add more functionality, but I am very happy with the progress so far."

        description: "Using the skills I learned from my first web development bootcamp, I built Tesla Mart. Tesla Mart is a CRUD web app  where current and future Tesla owners can buy and sell their vehicles.  The layout was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, while the back-end was built using the REST architecture with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.  Every page of the website is fully responsive.  The filtering and sorting functionality was difficult to implement, but it is now flawless. The filter dropdowns update depending on which other filters are active."
